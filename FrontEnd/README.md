https://frontend.turing.io/

### Module 1

Module 1 focuses on building a foundation for Front End Engineering and some of the tools and processes necessary for development. Students will learn to write semantic HTML, build responsive layouts, and write clean, refactored JavaScript that utilizes DOM manipulation, Object-Oriented Programming concepts, and Test-Driven Development. Projects will reinforce lesson concepts by emphasizing Object-Oriented Programming, comp recreation including responsive design, and clean, readable code.

### Module 2

Module 2 focuses on fundamental JavaScript concepts, popular patterns for writing and organizing front-end code, and learning new tools and workflows to help improve the development process for more complex applications. Projects will reinforce lesson concepts by emphasizing Object-Oriented Programming, Test-Driven Development and heavy data manipulation.

### Module 3

Module 3 focuses on front-end frameworks and libraries for building complex, scalable, fully-tested applications, as well as diving into asynchronous JavaScript and consuming APIs. Primary tools used are React, React Router, and Redux. Projects are designed to reinforce lesson concepts by allowing students to practice implementing network requests, frameworks, and testing in applications that range from small and simple to larger and more complex.
