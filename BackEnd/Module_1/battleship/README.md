## Battleship

## Overview

In this project, you will write a program to simulate a set of flash cards. A user will be able to see the questions, make guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

In order to build good habits, weâ€™ve broken the project into small classes to demonstrate objects that have a single responsibility.

## Learning Goals

- Utilize Test Driven Development
- Practice Algorithmic Thinking
- Create an Object Oriented solution to a problem without being given full specifications
- ~Work in a pair~
- Use Pull Requests ~to collaborate with a partner~
